n trouble again, aren't I?
I thought as much
'Cause you turned over there
Pulling that silent disappointment face
The one that I can't bare
Well, can't we just laugh and joke around?
Remember cuddles in the kitchen, yeah
To get things off the ground
And it was up, up and away
Oh, but it's right hard to remember that
On a day like today
When you're all argumentative
And you've got the face on
And, yeah, I'm sorry I was late
But I missed the train
And then the traffic was a state
And I can't be arsed to carry
